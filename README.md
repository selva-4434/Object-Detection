Object Detection Project

Welcome to my Object Detection project! 
This repository contains the code and resources for an object detection system built with deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to identify and classify objects within images, using a variety of modern algorithms and frameworks.
Whether you're a fellow machine learning enthusiast or just exploring, you're in the right place to get a hands-on understanding of how object detection works. Below, you'll find everything you need to understand, run, and even contribute to this project.

Features
Deep Learning Models: Uses cutting-edge neural network architectures for detecting and classifying objects in images (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN).
Pre-trained Weights: To get started quickly, pre-trained models are available, meaning you don't have to train from scratch (unless you want to, of course!).
High-Performance Detection: This project is optimized to run efficiently and accurately even on larger datasets.
Custom Dataset Support: Easily train your model with your own dataset or use popular object detection benchmarks like COCO or Pascal VOC.
Real-Time Detection: Depending on the model, this system can detect objects in real-time, making it ideal for practical use cases like video surveillance or live event monitoring.

How It Works
Data Preparation: Collect and annotate your dataset. This can be done with tools like LabelImg or Roboflow.
Model Training: The deep learning model learns to detect objects by being trained on the annotated data. You can fine-tune pre-trained models for your specific dataset or start from scratch if you have the resources.
Object Detection: Once the model is trained, you can run inference on new images or video streams to detect objects in real-time.
Evaluation: Metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision) help you understand how well the model is performing.

Getting Started
To get started with this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (or conda) for managing packages
A deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/selva-4434/object-detection-project.git
cd object-detection-project
Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or if you're using conda:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate object-detection-env
Prepare your dataset: If you're training a custom model, make sure your dataset is properly annotated and stored in the correct format (e.g., COCO, Pascal VOC).
Run the model: If you want to test the pre-trained model on some sample images:
python detect.py --image /path/to/image.jpg
